# Autonomous-Agents

This project is based from Daniel Shiffman's book- Nature of Code, specifically chapter 6 about Autonomous Agents.

In [Craig Reynold's paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/) about simulating the behaviour of flock of birds, he described that we can simulate their behaviour by just creating 3 simple rules:
- separation - every object should have a force to separate from other near objects
- alignment - every object should align its direction with other near objects
- cohesion - every object should have a force to group with other near objects (opposite of separation)
